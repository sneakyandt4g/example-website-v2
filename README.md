# example-website Repository!

This is made for absolute beginners who just started using GitHub and want to make a website using it.

Continue to read this guide to learn the basic knowledge!

# What is this file?

This file is not displayed on your website. It's only displayed on your website if it's the only Markdown file in the repository!

This file is meant for people looking at the source-code to read it!

# Domains n Stuff

Every GitHub account gets autoassigned a domain to it. (And if you think you have to pay for this domain, you'd be wrong!)

Since my username is @ST5Sneaky, my domain is `https://st5sneaky.github.io/`.

If your username was...username. your domain would be `https://username.github.io/`.

If it was @ghost, your domain would be `https://ghost.github.io/`.

You get the point.

# Subsites

I'm going to be using @ghost in all of the GitHub domains. Please pretend like that's YOUR GitHub username.

So if you were to fork this repository, and name your fork **page** and your username is @ghost and you applied GitHub Pages on the fork, the site would be hosted on `https://ghost.github.io/page`.

But what if you wanted to host it on `https://ghost.github.io/` and not `https://ghost.github.io/page`?

Well, you have to name the fork **ghost.github.io**. I don't know why but that's what GitHub wants.

# So what's these .md files?

Markdown. They are the best and most simple way to create a GitHub Pages site.

To learn the entirety of Markdown's features: [Click here.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

All you need to do is read a little bit of that guide and learn the text formatting.

That's all the knowledge you need to know of Markdown to make sites.

Of course, you can go more and learn more about Markdown, but all you need to know is that.

# Fork, fork, fork!
